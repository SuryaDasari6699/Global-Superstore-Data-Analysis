# üßæ Global Superstore Data Analysis

## üìå About
A complete data analysis and visualization project using **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to uncover sales trends, shipping inefficiencies, and customer behavior in a global retail dataset.

---

## üß† Overview
This project analyzes a global superstore‚Äôs sales data to generate actionable insights. It focuses on trends in product performance, customer segmentation, operational inefficiencies, and the financial impact of discounts and delivery delays.

The approach follows a structured ETL and BI development pipeline‚Äîtransforming raw transactional data into a clean, analytical star schema and delivering visual dashboards in Power BI.

## üéØ Business Objectives

1. Detect underperforming product categories generating low or negative profit  
2. Identify regions with high shipping costs leading to net losses  
3. Analyze customer segment profitability and average order values  
4. Optimize discount strategies based on margin analysis  
5. Quantify loss due to delayed high-priority shipments

## üß© Analytical Approach

**1. Data Cleaning & Modeling**
- Cleaned and formatted dates, profit columns, and discounts  
- Built a **star schema** with fact and dimension tables  
- Validated joins using SQL foreign keys  

**2. KPI & Metric Development**
- Defined DAX measures: Profit Margin, Net Profit, AOV  
- Created calculated columns: Discount Tiers, Shipping Delays  

**3. Power BI Visualization**
- Built 5 interactive dashboard pages for key business areas  
- Used slicers, bookmarks, and drill-throughs for dynamic exploration

## üß© Data Structures (Star Schema)

All tables are joined using foreign key constraints `Customer_ID` and `Product_ID` to build a clean, optimized star schema.
